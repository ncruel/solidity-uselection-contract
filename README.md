# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/deploy-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

# Hardhat install, config, run, deploy

```shell
# 1. Create npm project
npm init

# 2. Install Hardhat
npm install --save-dev hardhat

# 3. Create Hardhat project
npx hardhat

# 4. Compiling contracts
npx hardhat compile

# 5. Run Hardhat local node
npx hardhat node

# 6. Deploy contract
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy-script.js
```
